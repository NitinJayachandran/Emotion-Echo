EmotionEcho
Music is an essential part of our lives. It has the power to evoke emotions, trigger memories, and influence our mood.
Emotion Echo, aims to address this limitation by developing an emotion-based music recommendation system that can accurately detect a user's emotional state through their voice input and provide personalized recommendations that align with their current mood.
The existing systems often rely on past listening habits or user preferences which may not fully capture the nuances of the user's emotional state or provide real-time recommendations that address their current mood.
To address this limitation, our project provides personalized recommendations that accurately reflect the user's emotional state and offering the ability to shift to happier songs if needed, our project aims to offer a more satisfying and effective music recommendation system than what is currently available.

The project uses ReactJs that contains login page/registration page and landing page where playlists are displayed On click the user can play a song of his choice or there is autoplay,the user can also access his song listening history. There is also an admin page.The recommendation system used ML models like content based filtering and knn to process audio input and provide recommendations and the data is stored on MongoDB.
